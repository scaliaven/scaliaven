People often describe my mindset as young and dangerous—not in the reckless sense, but in the way youthful curiosity combines with a willingness to question assumptions and push into unexplored territory. It’s the energy that drives me to chase ideas at the intersection of science and technology, from understanding how molecules behave to designing systems that can learn, reason, and generate. This blend of ambition and intellectual fearlessness is what keeps me building, experimenting, and searching for the next breakthrough.
